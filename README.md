# DS3000: Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning
By: Zoe Graneta, Allison So, Jeremy Tran, Julie Vo, Helen Zhou

This project aimed to develop a model for predicting breast cancer diagnoses, using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset to classify breast cancer tumours as benign or malignant. Data preprocessing involved converting diagnostic labels and selecting predictive features. We tested polynomial logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models. The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy and a 100% recall rate, effectively minimizing false negatives. Our findings show machine learning's potential as a cost-effective, accessible and reliable tool for early detection while improving outcomes in breast cancer diagnostics.
